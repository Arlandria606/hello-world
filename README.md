# hello-world
A second test project.

This is me writing some things about myself.

That is as much personal information and I'm prepared to put out on the public Internet...

...except that I really, really, love yarn.

So much so that I'm going to Yarndale. A whole weekend (long weekend!) just to look at yarn. Well, and other knitting / crochet things. But mostly yarn.

Another arbitrary change!

Yet another change!

And another!
